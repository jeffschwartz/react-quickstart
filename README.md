# React Quick Start
A ReactJS Quick Start project that supports JavaScript ES7 transpilation to ES5 through Babel, linting with ESLint, and bundling via Webpack.

## Includes:
* React
* React Bootstrap
* React CSS Transition Group
* Redux
* Redux Form
* Redux Thunk
* Webpack
* Babel
* ESLint
* Axios

## Install
Clone or download the repo.

## Run:
1. At the command prompt, enter `npm start` to start the Webpack Dev Server with Hot Module Replacement.
1. Point your browser to `localhost:8080`. When you make changes to the code, Babel will transpile your code, Webpack will build the JavaScript bundle and Webpack Dev Server will refresh the browser.

## Note
If you cloned this repo (as opposed to having downloaded it) you should delete the `.git` folder (e.g. `rm -rf .git`) as you don't really want to track this repo. You can then, of course, create a new git repo to track your own work.
